## 🧠 AI Knowledge Base & Speak to Data (Phase 2)

The **AI Knowledge Base** allows each company to train its private AI system using its own documents, notes, or voice commands.

### How It Works
1. Upload text, docs, or audio through the Knowledge Base.  
2. The AI analyzes and stores the content in a secure vector memory database.  
3. You can later “speak to your data” — asking questions directly about your business files.  
4. The AI recalls and summarizes the information instantly, like having a virtual operations manager.

This system gives every user a **custom memory model** — your AI assistant learns and improves as your company grows.

## 💡 Speak to Data

A natural evolution of AI chat, *Speak to Data* lets you:
- Use your **voice or text** to upload knowledge.  
- Store it automatically inside your business Knowledge Base.  
- Ask natural questions like:  
  > “What did we project for marketing spend last quarter?”  
  > “Summarize our new business plan.”  
  > “List all uploaded tax documents.”

It transforms your BizCore360 AI into a true **intelligent business companion**.

Inside the avatar menu, you’ll find:
- **Admin** → Settings, Master Specs, and About pages.

All content pages are Markdown-based (`.md`) for easy editing and synchronization with the AI’s memory database.
